- Search queries now properly use `$wpdb->esc_like()` combined with wildcards (`%`) to safely handle user-provided search terms.
- The fast checkout feature UI & UX has been refactored.

### Service Subscription Status Refactored
- The core logic for determining service subscription status has been encapsulated within the `SmartWoo_Service` class.
- Introduced `SmartWoo_Service::get_effective_status()`, a new public method that provides the definitive service status, adhering to a strict precedence of explicit database overrides, cached values, and dynamically calculated date-based conditions.
- Private helper methods (e.g., `is_active_condition()`, `is_due_for_renewal_condition()`, `is_in_grace_period_condition()`, `is_expired_condition()`) are now used internally by `get_effective_status()` for specific condition checks.
- The global `smartwoo_service_status()` function has been simplified to delegate status determination to `SmartWoo_Service::get_effective_status()`.
- Naming consistency for private status condition methods has been improved for better clarity.
